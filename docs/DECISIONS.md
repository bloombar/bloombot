# Decisions

A running record of judgment calls made during the platform build, so "why is it like this?" has an answer
that outlives the conversation that produced it.

Each entry states the **problem**, the **choice**, what was **not** chosen and why, and the **limits** of the
choice — the conditions under which it should be revisited. Entries recording a decision _not_ to build
something, or reversing an earlier call, are as valuable as the rest.

## D-1 — The bot is rewritten in TypeScript rather than kept in Python

**Problem.** The web control panel is TypeScript (Vite + React + Express + zod). The bot is Python
(`discord.py`, ~1,100 lines across `response_bot.py` and `discord_manager.py`). A multi-tenant platform needs
both to share a tenant model, a config schema, and a data layer.

**Choice.** Rewrite the bot in TypeScript (discord.js 14 + the OpenAI Node SDK). One language, one toolchain,
one set of zod schemas shared end to end, one deployment story.

**Why not keep Python.** A polyglot monorepo would have kept the existing pytest suite and the proven
`responses.create` call, at the cost of two toolchains, two CI jobs, and a tenant/config contract duplicated
by hand on both sides — where the two copies drifting is a cross-tenant data leak rather than a type error.

**Limits.** The rewrite is the highest-risk work in the plan and touches the only component already serving
real students, which is why Phase 4 does it before any web work and pins the surviving behaviour with tests
(see SPEC BOT-*). If the port proves unable to reproduce current behaviour, the fallback is to keep the
Python bot reading tenant config from the shared database — recoverable, but it costs the shared schema.

## D-2 — SQLite is kept, but the data model is written to be portable

**Problem.** A multi-tenant platform with three writing processes (bot, API, worker) on one droplet.

**Choice.** Stay on SQLite with WAL, `busy_timeout`, one shared data package, and Drizzle — but hold the
schema and every query to a portable subset so Postgres is a configuration change rather than a rewrite.

**Why not Postgres now.** It is the technically safer answer for concurrent writers, and it was explicitly
considered and declined: the operational cost of a second daemon to install, secure, back up, monitor and
deploy is not yet earned by the load, and WAL handles a single-host deployment with room to spare.

**Limits.** This holds only while the deployment is single-host. The rules that keep the escape hatch open —
all SQL confined to `packages/db/src/repos/`, no SQLite-only idioms outside `migrations/`, the job-claim
dialect split isolated behind one repo function, full-text search behind a `SearchIndex` port rather than
FTS5 directly, money as INTEGER micros — are load-bearing, not stylistic. Breaking any of them quietly
converts "a config change" into "a rewrite". A CI migration-parity check keeps the claim honest.

## D-3 — Stored OpenAI prompt ids are replaced by instructions held in the database

**Problem.** Course prompts live as `prompt_id` references to the OpenAI dashboard. Tenants will not have an
OpenAI account, so they can never author or inspect one.

**Choice.** Store instruction text in `courses.instructions` and pass it inline to `responses.create`.
Version it in `course_instruction_revisions`. Keep `courses.prompt_id` as a nullable escape hatch: when set
it wins, so the two existing courses behave identically on day one.

**Why not manage stored prompts through the API on tenants' behalf.** It mirrors, as an opaque external
artifact, a field that already exists in `bot_config.yml` — and it keeps a failure mode ("the prompt id was
deleted in the dashboard") that cannot be diagnosed from the control panel.

**Limits.** Inline instructions are re-sent on every request, so a very long instruction has a token cost a
stored prompt would not. Revisit if instruction length becomes material.

---

## D-4 — Conversations and daily limits key on (course, person), not on a surface account

**Problem.** Today's in-memory maps key on the Discord member object, so a student in two courses shares one
conversation and one budget, and both reset on every deploy.

**Choice.** `bot_conversations` and `usage_counters` key on `(course_id, end_user_id)`, where `end_user_id`
identifies the person across Discord, web and MCP. `courses.max_requests_per_day` is that person's allowance
**in that course**, not a pooled course total.

**Why not key on the surface account.** Context would not follow a student from Discord to the web chat, and
a daily limit could be evaded by switching surface.

**Limits.** Cross-surface continuity is not always wanted — an instructor may consider a web session distinct
from a Discord thread. `courses.conversation_scope` (`course` | `course_surface`) exists for that.

---

## D-5 — Platform-admin review is per slice, by a different agent, with bounded rework

**Problem.** The supervisor delegates implementation and therefore sees summaries rather than every edit.

**Choice.** Every slice is reviewed by two fresh-context agents that did not write it: `/code-review` for
correctness and `spec-reviewer` for conformance. `spec-reviewer` **re-runs the brief's check itself** rather
than trusting reported output. Findings are triaged, not auto-applied, on a three-tier bar. Re-review is
capped at two rounds; a third means the slice was mis-scoped and gets re-split.

**Why not the documented two-session Writer/Reviewer pattern.** It requires a human to relay findings between
windows on every slice, which is incompatible with running unattended to a first draft. A reviewer subagent
preserves the property that matters — a fresh model that did not write the code does the grading — without
the relay.

**Limits.** A reviewer asked to find gaps will find some even when the work is sound. The three-tier bar and
the two-round cap exist to stop that becoming defensive scaffolding and tests for impossible cases.

## D-6 — Auto-merge everything into the migration branch; `master` needs approval

**Problem.** Slices should merge on green and move on, without waiting on a human — but a merge to `master`
is not the same kind of event as a merge into a feature branch.

**Choice.** Every slice and phase PR targets `feat/PLAT-1-multi-surface-platform` and auto-merges on green
(`gh pr merge --auto --squash --delete-branch`), self-approved. **Promotion from that branch to `master` is
the operator's decision and is never automatic.** Direct pushes to `master` are in the permission deny list.

**Why the exception.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` fires its deploy job on `refs/heads/master` and ships to
the droplet running the live bot for real students, so a `master` merge is a production deployment. The whole
JavaScript migration therefore lands on one long-lived branch and is promoted deliberately, not incidentally.

**Limits.** A long-lived branch accumulates divergence from `master`. Anything shipped to `master` in the
meantime — a hotfix to the Python bot — must be merged _into_ the migration branch promptly, or the promotion
becomes a conflict resolution nobody wants to review.

**Limits.** Auto-merge is only meaningful once required status checks are configured on the integration
branch; without them `--auto` has nothing to wait for and merges immediately.

**Confirmed the hard way, 2026-08-31.** The first PR (#74) did exactly that — it merged before CI finished,
because nothing was required. The checks passed afterwards, so nothing was lost, but the gate was decorative.
Branch protection is now applied to `feat/PLAT-1-multi-surface-platform` requiring **Python tests**, **Board
tooling tests** and **Shell script lint**, with `strict: true` so a branch must be up to date with its base
before merging, and force-pushes and deletions disabled. Adding a CI job means adding its name to that
protection, or the gate silently stops covering it.

## D-7 — Agent guardrails are hooks, not instructions

**Problem.** `data/data.db` holds 99 real students' names, emails and 927 conversation transcripts, and a
`.env` with a live bot token and OpenAI key sits in the working tree of a public repository.

**Choice.** A blocking `PreToolUse` hook (`.claude/hooks/guard-paths.sh`) refuses writes to `data/*.db`,
`.env*`, `logs/*.log` and `results/*.csv`, and refuses `git add -f` and commands that delete or overwrite the
live database. It has its own regression tests in `npm test`.

**Why not a CLAUDE.md rule.** CLAUDE.md is advisory and competes for attention with everything else in the
file; a hook is deterministic and cannot be forgotten mid-session.

**Limits.** The guard is scoped to `data/` rather than every `*.db`, because the test suites deliberately
write throwaway databases under `tmp/` and blocking those would break the build instead of protecting
anything. It guards modification, not inspection: reads are allowed, so it is not a defence against
exfiltration by a hostile agent — it is a defence against accident.

---

## D-8 — Permissions are permissive; the hook is the safety net

**Problem.** A narrowed permission allowlist was interrupting the operator with approval prompts on routine
commands, which defeats the requirement to run unattended.

**Choice.** Broad tool permissions (`Bash`, `Edit`, `Write`) with a short deny list for the genuinely
irreversible: force-push, direct push to `master`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, `rm -rf /` or `~`,
`ssh`/`scp`, `pm2`, and piping anything into a shell.

**Why this is not a loosening.** The real protection moved from permission prompts to
`.claude/hooks/guard-paths.sh` (D-7), which is deterministic, tested, and blocks the specific paths that
matter regardless of which tool tries to touch them. A prompt asks a human to notice; a hook does not need
anyone to be watching. Prompts were catching the wrong things anyway — `npm ls`, `git for-each-ref` — while
the thing actually worth blocking was a path, not a command.

**Limits.** The deny list is pattern-matched on the command string and can be evaded by an agent that wants
to (a differently-spelled `rm`, a script that force-pushes). It is a guard against accident, not against a
hostile agent. The same is true of the path hook: it guards modification, not exfiltration.

## D-9 — `DATABASE_PATH` and `SQL_LITE_DB_PATH` coexist during the migration

**Problem.** `packages/config`'s zod schema names the SQLite file `DATABASE_PATH`. The live Python bot reads
the same file through `SQL_LITE_DB_PATH` (`models/base.py`, `migrate.py`, `tests/conftest.py`), a name chosen
years before this package existed. `env.example` originally documented only the new name.

**Choice.** Keep `DATABASE_PATH` as the name in the TypeScript schema — it is the name every future
TypeScript process will read — but add `SQL_LITE_DB_PATH` to `env.example` too, as a plain documented
variable the zod schema does not know about, with a comment that both must point at the same file for as long
as the Python bot and the TypeScript platform are both writing to it.

**Why not rename one to match the other.** Renaming the Python side mid-migration touches
`response_bot.py`/`migrate.py`/`models/base.py` for no behavioural gain and widens a config-only slice into a
bot change. Renaming the TypeScript schema to the legacy name would carry the old name's awkwardness
(`SQL_LITE_DB_PATH`, not `SQLITE_DB_PATH`) into the code that has no history obligating it to.

**Limits.** Two variables naming one file is a trap for exactly the deployment this note is trying to
prevent: setting one and not the other silently forks the bot and the platform onto two different databases,
with no error until the data has already diverged. It should be deleted the moment the Python bot is retired
(D-1) and only `DATABASE_PATH` remains.

## D-10 — The legacy YAML schema mirrors the Python reader's optionality, not the ideal shape

**Problem.** `packages/schemas/legacy-yaml.ts` originally required `openai_assistant.name`, `instructions`,
`vector_store_id`, `model` and `limits.max_requests_per_day`. `response_bot.py` never reads `name` or
`instructions` at all, and reads `model`, `vector_store_id` and `limits.max_requests_per_day` with
`oa_config.get(key, default)` — so a course that has never set one of those keys runs today, and the stricter
schema would have rejected its own config file the moment it was pointed at a course omitting one.

**Choice.** Make those fields `optional()` rather than required, and leave their defaults where the bot
applies them (`OPENAI_DEFAULT_MODEL`, `OPENAI_DEFAULT_MAX_REQUEST_PER_DAY`, `None`) instead of duplicating the
default value inside the schema. `prompt_id` stays required: without it the bot logs a warning and never
answers in that course (`response_bot.py:208`), so a course missing it cannot function even though the
reader does not crash on the missing key.

**Why not tighten instead of loosen.** A schema stricter than the code it models reads like a specification
of how `bot_config.yml` _should_ look, but its job here is narrower: catch a typo before the bot silently
answers nobody, without also rejecting a file the bot itself accepts. Tightening these fields is a legitimate
future change — once the schema is the thing authors are told to satisfy, rather than a check against a
reader nobody has changed yet — but it is a decision about the format, not a bug in this slice.

**Limits.** Because the schema now permits what the reader tolerates, a course silently missing a field
(nobody ever set `model`) parses identically to one that intentionally omitted it. If that distinction ever
matters, it needs the config format to say so explicitly, not a stricter schema.

---

## D-11 — `packages/db`: two unscoped repo functions, application-generated ids, and app-set timestamps

**Problem.** TEN-2 requires that "every data-access function takes the organization id as its first
parameter" and that "there is no function that fetches a scoped record by id alone" — but `accounts` and
`discord_server_bindings` each have exactly one operation that cannot satisfy that literally, because the
organization is not yet known at the point the function is called.

**Choice.** Two documented exceptions, enforced by an allowlist a test checks against (rather than left as a
comment nobody re-reads):

- `accounts.getAccountByEmail(email, db)` — an account is a sign-in identity, not something scoped to one
  organization (the same account can belong to several, through `memberships`), and it has to be found by
  email _before_ sign-in knows which organization is relevant. Every other function in `accounts.ts` reaches
  the account through an organization's membership instead (`getAccountInOrganization`,
  `disableAccountInOrganization`), so a cross-tenant read still looks like absence (TEN-5).
- `discord-servers.resolveDiscordServerBinding(serverId, db)` — this _is_ the lookup that establishes which
  organization an incoming Discord message belongs to; it cannot itself take an organization id as input
  without begging the question. It returns `undefined` for both an unbound server and a released one
  (`removed_at` set), which is the correct behaviour either way: no organization currently owns that server's
  messages.

Everything else — including `organizations.ts`'s own `createOrganization`/`getOrganizationById`, where the
"organization id" being scoped by is the row's own id — takes `organizationId` as its first parameter, and
`tests/tenant-scoping-convention.test.ts` reads the actual source of `src/repos/**` to prove it, rather than
trusting every future PR to remember the rule.

**Ids and timestamps.** Every primary key is an application-generated UUID (`crypto.randomUUID()`, called in
the repo layer or supplied by the caller — `organizations.createOrganization` takes its id as an argument, the
same way every scoped function takes its scoping id as one), not `AUTOINCREMENT`: an auto-incrementing integer
key is a SQLite/Postgres detail a schema held to D-2's portable subset should not depend on, and it lets a
repo function hand back the id of a row before reading it back. Timestamps are `INTEGER` epoch milliseconds,
set with `Date.now()` in the repo layer rather than a SQL default — `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` means seconds-as-text
in SQLite and a native timestamp type in Postgres, so a SQL default would be one more thing to rewrite the day
the engine changes.

**TEN-3's re-claim.** `claimDiscordServerBinding` is a `SELECT` followed by an `INSERT` or `UPDATE` chosen in
application code, not an `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE ... WHERE`. The latter is still portable SQL (D-2
allows it), but the explicit select-then-write reads plainly as the three cases TEN-3 actually describes
(never bound / released and re-claimable / actively bound elsewhere) without leaning on `ON CONFLICT`'s
less-obvious "conditional no-op" semantics — worth it here since better-sqlite3 is synchronous and
single-threaded, so there is no other code that can run between the `SELECT` and the following write.

**Limits.** The two-step claim is not safe against a second, *concurrent* writer process racing the same
snowflake — fine for a single SQLite connection today, but something to revisit if `packages/db` ever gains a
second writer to this table before the Postgres migration D-2 leaves open.
